This repository contains
[Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) conformance tests.
The tests are same with
[Knative networking](https://github.com/knative/networking/tree/main/test/conformance)
but against Gateway API resources without Knative Ingress.

[Knative docs](https://github.com/knative/docs) repository.
