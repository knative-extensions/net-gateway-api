    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # When configuring Gateways below if 'service' is not provided,
    # net-gateway-api will use the first address on the Gateway status
    # for probing. This is useful when the Gateway proxy is off cluster.
